			<p>The sea otter is an adorable mammal that lives in shallow waters off the coast of the North Pacific Ocean. Covered in thick, dense fur, the sea otter feeds on many of the sea's other inhabitants, such as urchins, mussels and even octupi. Sea otters
				are considered a keystone species, meaning their role in the ecosystem is vital to maintain a delicate balance. As such, it is vital for the continued conservation and reintroduction of this species.</p>
